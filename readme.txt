IMPROVEMENT

Created User Interface for Client and Server Interaction


DESCRIPTION

This project is meant for multi-interactive client-server process. The client connects to the server and uses certain commands which triggers
an action from the server. The client is able to look at files, upload files and download files in this project.

HOW TO RUN THE CODE

To run the code, you can compile it as a JAVAFX application. This will take you to our UI where DIR shows automatically. To upload a file or to download a file, 
select a file from our UI and then click either the Upload button or the Download Button.

Then run both the server and the client java files separately.

Note: Due to errors in some of our logic, ClientThread.java and Main.Java currently do not properly run.
